 * fswrap.c - file system fixes for XRoar on Circle's FatFs.
 *
 * FatFs cannot stat() the root directory of a volume, so BMCoco's file
 * browser would think "/" doesn't exist and refuse to go up to it. The
 * kernel is linked with --wrap=stat, so every call to stat() comes here
 * first; the root (and ".") are reported as directories, everything else
 * goes to the real stat().
